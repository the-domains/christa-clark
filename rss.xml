            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>One</h1><h2>Tabula Rasa</h2><p>An absence of preconceived ideas or predetermined goals; a clean slate, is exactly what I was given when my tiny body was born into this world. I remember nothing, but I know I was, if only for a brief moment, whole, complete, and perfect. We start out that way and then seem to spend our adult lives trying to get back to that space of mind overflowing with purity and bliss. Teddy, aka my earthly, akashic record was my best friend. </p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Christa's love story with the tech industry began while teaching financial literacy to kids after school, and conceptualizing an app to drive home this topic in everyday life. From there Christa built her brainchild: Heartworthy Co., a web design agency with the mission of rescuing professionals from outdated websites and poor user experiences. In this next chapter, she is now lead UX/UI designer for Skunkworx Lab. Responsive web design is her religion, and in her spare time spread the good word of Code to willing converts.</p>]]></description>
