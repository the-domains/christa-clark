## Fox Mulder

****

I began preschool and came home with my first portrait of "someone important to me," obviously being Fox Mulder. I was starting to get used to having a baby sister, and preschool was a nice distraction. I got to learn how to play with others kids. My favorite playground game was the "kissing game." The little girls and boys split into teams and would chase each other down and kiss each other.
