# One

## Tabula Rasa

An absence of preconceived ideas or predetermined goals; a clean slate, is exactly what I was given when my tiny body was born into this world. I remember nothing, but I know I was, if only for a brief moment, whole, complete, and perfect. We start out that way and then seem to spend our adult lives trying to get back to that space of mind overflowing with purity and bliss. Teddy, aka my earthly, akashic record was my best friend.
