  Christa's love story with the tech industry began while teaching financial
  literacy to kids after school, and conceptualizing an app to drive home this

  Co., a web design agency with the mission of rescuing professionals from
  outdated websites and poor user experiences. In this next chapter, she is now
  lead UX/UI designer for Skunkworx Lab. Responsive web design is her religion,
  and in her spare time spread the good word of Code to willing converts.
